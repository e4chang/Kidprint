This becomes \r\n\r\nProject Kidprint aims to solve that problem by going back to one of the \r\nearliest, but most reliable forms of identification - fingerprints. In\r\nconjunction with researchers and graduate students at the Qualcomm Institute at\r\nU.C. San Diego, our goal is to create a modular, intuitive, and cheap way of\r\nreliably reading the fingerprints of infants. While other attempts have been\r\nmade, the results have either been unsuccessful, or far too expensive and\r\ninaccessible. We hope to succeed where others have failed by taking a different\r\napproach to solving this problem - rather than take a specific technology and\r\nmold it to our needs, we are choosing to experiment with multiple technologies\r\nand picking the ones \r\n\r\nThe core steps of the identification process are these:\r\n1. Use a camera to take an image of the fingerprint\r\n2. Pass the image to a processing device\r\n3. Run the image through an image processing algorithm\r\n4. Use the metadata from the algorithm to search through a database\r\n5. Allow the user to view and modify the information of the infant\r\n\r\nThis repository contains the code for the first step - interfacing with the\r\nembedded devices that are used for the project. These include, but are not limited\r\nto, various cameras, an Arduino compatible microprocessor, and an Arduino\r\ncompatible Bluetooth module. The camera will be used to take the pictures of the\r\nfingerprints, and the Arduino modules will be used to implement an autofocus algorithm, that we hope to . We are rapidly cycling through\r\nprototypes, so the specific technologies are likely to change, but by using OpenCV\r\nand Arduino, both widely accepted standards, we guarantee that this code will\r\nbe modular across a multitude of devices.\r\n\r\nCurrent Camera:\r\nSee3CAM_CU51\r\nhttp://www.e-consystems.com/Monochrome-USB-Camera-board.asp\r\n\r\nCurrent Arduino board:\r\nSparkFun Pro Micro - 5V/16MHz\r\nhttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/12640\r\n\r\nCurrent Arduino Bluetooth module:\r\nSparkFun Bluetooth Modem - BlueSMiRF Silver\r\nhttps://www.sparkfun.com/products/12577\r\n",
