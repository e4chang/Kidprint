<p>One of the challenges that doctors in developing countries face is
identification - namely, how to keep track of patients that they have treated
and how to store their information. This becomes </p>

<p>Project Kidprint aims to solve that problem by going back to one of the 
earliest, but most reliable forms of identification - fingerprints. In
conjunction with researchers and graduate students at the Qualcomm Institute at
U.C. San Diego, our goal is to create a modular, intuitive, and cheap way of
reliably reading the fingerprints of infants. While other attempts have been
made, the results have either been unsuccessful, or far too expensive and
inaccessible. We hope to succeed where others have failed by taking a different
approach to solving this problem - rather than take a specific technology and
mold it to our needs, we are choosing to experiment with multiple technologies
and picking the ones </p>

<p>The core steps of the identification process are these:
1. Use a camera to take an image of the fingerprint
2. Pass the image to a processing device
3. Run the image through an image processing algorithm
4. Use the metadata from the algorithm to search through a database
5. Allow the user to view and modify the information of the infant</p>

<p>This repository contains the code for the first step - interfacing with the
embedded devices that are used for the project. These include, but are not limited
to, various cameras, an Arduino compatible microprocessor, and an Arduino
compatible Bluetooth module. The camera will be used to take the pictures of the
fingerprints, and the Arduino modules will be used to implement an autofocus algorithm, that we hope to . We are rapidly cycling through
prototypes, so the specific technologies are likely to change, but by using OpenCV
and Arduino, both widely accepted standards, we guarantee that this code will
be modular across a multitude of devices.</p>
